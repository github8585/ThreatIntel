Threat Intelligence Data from VirusTotal API

This Python code utilizes the requests and json modules to collect threat intelligence data from the VirusTotal API endpoint. The data is collected using an API key and is stored in a JSON file in the current directory.

The code includes a function called threat() that makes a request to the API endpoint and saves the data in a JSON file called threat.json using the json.dump() function. The JSON file is created with an indentation of 4 spaces for better readability.

To use this code, you need to replace file_id with the ID of the file you want to check and api_key with your own VirusTotal API key in the url and headers variables respectively.

Please note that VirusTotal API requires an API key to access their services. You need to have a valid API key to use this code.

You can modify the code to fit your needs or integrate it into your own applications to collect and analyze threat intelligence data from VirusTotal API.
